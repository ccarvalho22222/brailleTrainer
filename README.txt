This was a simple Braille trainer developed for an HCI Course taken at Umass Dartmouth in collaboration with Professor Les Cory.

Functionality works in that, a window opens up that acts as a key listener that listens for the push-down and press of certain
combinations of inputs, resulting in a system that directly mimics that of a standard braille keyboard, a resource fairly common
to most visually impaired people.

These presses are calculated when nothing is touched, and a corresponding value is hashed, and said out loud.

Users can also press key combinations to erase, read overall input, or start a new session.

It makes use of FreeTTS, an open-source text-to-speech library technology to deliver the audio.

Upon completion of this project, it was planned to extend upon it in to deeper systems, and possibly Grade 2 Braille,
but confirmation with Professor Les has not been returned since the final presentation of this project.

The standard control scheme consists of SDF-JKL and the Spacebar, as with most non-mechanical keybaords I ran in to
issues with ghosting and key-presses not being registered, with the standard DFG-HJK.
